# 0. I Created a Blog!
_I did it! I finally created a blog on my website!_

The idea behind this blog is primarily to **document the technologies** and **practices** implemented in my various **personal projects**.

I am a **28-year-old full-stack developer**, with a focus on **backend development**, holding an MBA in **Project Management Consulting**, and I am deeply interested in **devops practices** during my free time. After designing my portfolio, I constantly wondered how to keep it updated, make it more engaging, and then the idea came to me, almost like an obvious choice: I had to create a **blog**. Not only would the articles published give **visibility** to my portfolio, but they would also help showcase my **practices**, **projects**, and even serve as **documentation** for anyone who might need it.

In upcoming articles, I plan to present my **homelab** and various **personal projects**. It will be an opportunity to explain the **technical choices**, address the **issues faced**, and share my **learnings**.

I hope this blog will eventually become a real asset for my portfolio, but most importantly, that it will be useful to other developers, whether they are **beginners** or **experienced**.
