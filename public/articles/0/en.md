# 0. I created a blog
_It’s official—I’ve taken the leap: I finally created a blog on my website!_

The idea behind this blog is primarily to document the technologies and practices I've implemented across my various personal projects.

I’m a 28-year-old **full stack developer**, mainly focused on **backend** development, with an MBA in **Project Management Consulting**. In my spare time, I take a keen interest in **devops** practices. After designing my portfolio, I kept wondering how I could make it more dynamic and engaging. Then it hit me, almost like an obvious solution: I needed to create a blog. Publishing articles wouldn’t just give my portfolio more visibility; it would also allow me to highlight my practices, projects, and even serve as documentation for anyone who might need it.

In the upcoming articles, I plan to showcase my homelab and various personal projects. It’ll be an opportunity to explain the technical choices I’ve made, address the challenges I’ve faced, and share what I’ve learned along the way.

I hope this blog will eventually become a valuable asset for my portfolio, but more importantly, I hope it’ll be helpful to other developers, whether they’re beginners or experienced.

See you soon for the next article!
