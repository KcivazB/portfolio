Let's start from the beginning.

You may be wondering what a homelab is. If that's not the case, feel free to skip to the next section. Otherwise, I strongly encourage you to read the following passage.

> A homelab, or **home server**, is a computing environment designed to **test**, **experiment with**, and **develop technologies** without risking a production environment. It is often used by tech enthusiasts, students, or industry professionals to **learn**, **explore new solutions**, or **create unique setups**.

The concept of a homelab is based on a simple idea: anyone can create their own experimental environment, regardless of the hardware at their disposal.  
Whether it's a professional server, a mini-PC, an old computer, or even a Raspberry Pi, any machine can become a functional homelab. The idea is to experiment and test various tools without making a massive initial investment. Just be careful not to get too addictedâ€”the experience is so enjoyable that it's easy to lose track of time!

However, it's important to keep in mind that while nearly any hardware can be used to create your own homelab, the machine will need to be adapted to your needs.

For example, using a Raspberry Pi to run an image generation model might be challenging, just as using a professional server to host a simple website might seem overkill.
